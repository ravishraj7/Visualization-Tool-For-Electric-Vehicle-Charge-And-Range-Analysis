_Develops interactive dashboards to analyze EV charging behavior, range, efficiency, pricing, and tech trends (LTVIP2025TMID50379)._

🎯 **Objectives**  
---  
_Key goals include:_  
1. Analyze how range, acceleration, and efficiency affect EV pricing  
2. Compare EV distribution across segments, brands, and regions  
3. Contrast global EV trends with Indian market behaviors  
4. Provide actionable insights through data-driven visuals  
5. Offer intuitive, interactive dashboards for users  

🔍 **Key Visualizations**  
---  
*Dashboards include:*  

| # | Visualization | Description |
|:-:|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Market Overview** | Avg range (~347 km), price (~€52K), ~95 models |
| 2 | **Performance vs Pricing** | Scatterplot (price vs range) + efficiency heatmap |
| 3 | **Technology & Features** | Rapid‑charge share (~89% premium), powertrains, plug types |
| 4 | **Market Segmentation** | Brand share treemaps; body-style vs price vs region |
| 5 | **Efficiency & Sustainability** | Range box plots by powertrain; acceleration vs speed; efficiency tiers (<170 Wh/km “Excellent”, 170–200 Wh/km “Good”) |

👍 **Advantages**  
---  
*Standout benefits:*  
- User-friendly & interactive; no coding required  
- Comprehensive coverage: charging, range, tech, price, efficiency, segmentation  
- Suitable for both global and India-specific EV analysis  

👎 **Disadvantages**  
---  
*Key limitations:*  
- Data accuracy dependent on dataset quality  
- Mostly static visualizations without real-time data  
- Lacks built-in predictive analytics—needs external ML tools  

🚀 **Future Scope**  
---  
*Enhancement opportunities:*  
- Add ML-driven predictive modeling  
- Integrate live charging station and vehicle telemetry data  
- Monitor battery lifecycle and degradation trends  
- Include CO₂ savings and environmental impact metrics  
- Optimize dashboards for mobile/tablet responsiveness  

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**  
---  
*Tech stack overview:*  
- **Tableau Public/Desktop** – Dashboard creation  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data preparation and cleanup  
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration  
- **Statistical Analysis** – Custom metrics: range, efficiency, pricing, comparisons  

📈 **Key Insights**  
---  
*Top takeaways:*  
- **Tesla** leads in average range (~347 km)  
- **Premium EVs**: ~89% support rapid charging  
- **AWD powertrains**: better performance, slightly less efficient  
- **Efficiency tiers**: <170 Wh/km ("Excellent"); 170–200 Wh/km ("Good")  
- Noticeable price–range segmentation across brands and regions  

🧾 **Conclusion**  
---  
This project transforms complex EV market data into clear, interactive Tableau dashboards. It surfaces key patterns—Tesla’s range dominance, premium model charging readiness, and efficiency stratification—providing stakeholders with actionable insights. While real-time data and forecasting aren’t yet implemented, the foundation is solid, ready for enhancements in ML analytics, telemetry integrations, and sustainability tracking.
